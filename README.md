# ncbuilder2baseinstall
Scripts to automatically build a Nextcloud Docker stack. 
The intent is to extend this awesome work done by Joshblades and add some other dockers behind the same Traefik.
This is a learning process for me so don't laugh :-) 
You can help or go away, we all have to start somewhere.
I am really inspired by the great work of JoshBlades in this ncblades release.
I am a noob looking at learning more about Traefik as per my requirements.
Let's see where this goes :-)
